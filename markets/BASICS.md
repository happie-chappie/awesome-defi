  - In a liquid market, the trade-off is mild: one can sell quickly without having to accept a significantly lower price.
  - In a relatively illiquid market, an asset must be discounted in order to sell quickly
  - A liquid asset has some or all of the following features

		- It can be sold rapidly, with minimal loss of value, anytime within market hours

- #### Liquidity Risk

	- Liquidity risk is the risk that a company or individual will not be able to meet short-term financial obligations due to the inability to convert assets into cash without incurring a loss.

	- This most often occurs when assets (such as securities) cannot be sold for a reasonable price due to a lack of buyers, large price movements, or widening bid-ask spreads.
